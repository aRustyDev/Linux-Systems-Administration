Ensure that only the admin has general sudo access.
sudo -lU admin

- ![directories i created for my investigation](./homework4/snap_5.png)

Command to add admin to the sudo group: sudo usermod -aG admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder
Add an engineers group to the system.

Command to add group: 
sudo addgroup engineers

Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.
Command to create the shared folder:
sudo mkdir group_sharefolder -p /home/engineer

- ![directories i created for my investigation](./homework4/snap_9.png)

Command to see documentation and instructions: 
man lynis

- ![directories i created for my investigation](./homework4/snap_12.png)


Command to run an audit: 
sudo lynis audit system

- ![directories i created for my investigation](./homework4/snap_13.png)

Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
